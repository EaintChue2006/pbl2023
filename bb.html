	<p><b>Review: </b> Today, I would like to share about Hotpot Paradise. The price is fair and include sushi buffet. Time is also unlimited. There has many seafoods in hotpot buffet. Even has salmon tuna in sushi. For drinks, Cola, Sprite and other 2 milkshakes are available. We don’t even feel hot because air con is so cold.  If you want to take away, it just costs 9600kyats. It includes 3 kinds of meats and vegetables. They also give a bottle of milk tea as gift. It’s real honest review.

		<b>Review: </b> Singapore Hot Pot buffet is already available in Yangon! The shop name is “Paradise Hotpot MM”. It is premium Hotpot buffet. There have 4 types of packages. The difference between Premium and Set-A is included beer and not. If you do not link to drink beer, so Set-A is suitable for you. There have 8 flavors of Hotpot soup. If you are spicy lover, I recommend you have spicy Sichuan soup. Chicken Collagen soup is also not bad. Their collagen is similar with Beauty in the pot’s. To cut a long story to short, their soups are not bad. Tom-Yom taste is little bit soil. I like the most is meat quality. Their meats are so juicy. Australia Angus beef is popular in there. Seafoods are also fresh. They also have handmade meat balls. It is also one of my favorites. You should try these premium handmade balls when you go there. Side dishes are not so much special. There have Cola, Sprite and Orange for drink. You can buy other drinks of you want. They do not have so many desserts and ice cream. There just have 2 flavors of ice cream but they are tasty.

		<b>Review: </b> Hong Kong Paradise is a Cantonese restaurant. There have 14 different kinds of breakfast for buffet.  They are dim sum, rice soup, fried rice, and other side dishes. And can also get tea and coffee for drink. Dim sums are big, and taste is not bad. I would like to give 3.8 out of 5 for taste. Fried rice, fried dimpling and bun are also good. Their pro is do not need to wait for a long time. They give 1 hour and 15 minutes  for time limit. Breakfast buffet is from 9AM to 12PM but kitchen is close at 11:30AM. Price is 19800kyats for elders and 13000kyats for children.

		<b>Review: </b> Their shop is crowded but do not need to wait for a long time as before. I just had to wait 15 minutes when I went. There have many places to sit, and you can choose to sit in shop with aircon or at outside. There have so many choices to choose and I love the most is mao cai taste. We can get real taste of mao cai. Prices are start from 500kyats. You can choose by yourself. There also have drinks. If you don't want to have drinks, there have ice-cream shop near them. And they also have other dishes. If you come to downtown, you should try it.

		<b>Review: </b> I like the most Western Park’s roast duck for the most because every time, I buy roast duck, they help us cut roast duck for can eat in many ways. And they will ask you want bone for soup or fried. Their soup is also delicious and can get many potions. Also include duck meat and vegetables fried side dish.

		<b>Review: </b> Among the Mala Xiang Guo shop, I like Chilli Pot for the most. It is not real Si Chuang taste, but it is also not Burmese taste. Smell and taste are different with other. There also available other dishes. The price is also fair. I bought for 20000kyats and can eat the whole day. If it is rainy day, it would be more delicious.
