	<p><b>Review: </b> I forgot the name of the red cake but i swear it is so delicious. 
 When I eat it, the taste of chocolate inside is so good that I don't feel nauseous.
The strawberry bingsu is also delicious, with strawberries mixed with coconut and milk flavored inside.
Cube latte is sweet and good to drink.
The price is just over 18,000 for those 3 types and a bottle of water.
I wanted to try more some bread and drinks. If you love delicious desserts, I recommend you to go Booboo cafe.

	<p><b>Review: </b> Modern Art Pics are hung in the shop, and with small plants, it's like going into a friendly MiniCafe from Bkk.
If you want to take photos, you can use your phone or camera. The lighting is very good and I like the IG Spot. Wifi and aircon are also available.
  Milktea Series and Cheese Tea Series. The price is also very fair. We ate fish fried stick, Mala Xiang Guo, blueberry drinks. 
The fish is fried with crisp and made into little sticks.And its very good. Also the Mala Xiang Guo is very tasty with lots of vegetables, sausage and meat.
The smell is so good. Blueberry juice alittle sweet and a little sour. I enjoyed drinking it.

		<b>Review: </b> The cafe is decorated in brown and green...
The cafe colour can make your eyes blessed and the complexion is calm
But the menu isn't quite complete yet because the cafe has just opened.
Since it's a cafe, there are more coffee menus
(Bread and Cake are available)
~ available 3 types of juice...
You will really feel the feeling of sitting and doing chillie in the forest.
(In the afternoon, how about hanging out outside?)
To take beautiful pictures, the outside is more beautiful
It's not a budget shop
Price of foods > starts around 6500. You can go there for breakfast or whenever you want to take a good pictures to post on instagram.

		<b>Review: </b>You can hung out with your friends
A great Roof Top place to chill
 One thing that is different from other shops is that the steaks are good, so I recommend them.
 Burger and sandwish sets,
For drinks, you need to try mocktails.
Even though it's not a central place, you will feel new vibes
It will be more convenient to go in the evening
take a selfie with Sunset. 
It's a rooftop style, so it's ok to chill. You can also do birthday parties
It's a good place. If u love to eat steaks, you will need this rooftop cafe.

		<b>Review: </b> I want to give a review to the cafe. It must be a foreigner target shop. Now that it has reopened, the menu is not very complete, but...
now the menu is very good with 'Shan food'. Absolutely, if you like Shan food, go there. Also, the price is 1800 for Shan noodles + coffee or tea .
It's very worth, isn't it?
Shan noodle in that cafe is very good.As for Shan Noodles, I give it 10/10.
Next is the fried khwpoke. So chewy and delicious, much better if you eat it with tofu. 
For coffee and tea, Both them include many milk creamy which make their taste so much better and different from other. 
It only cost 1200 for a cup and it's worth it.

		<b>Review: </b> If you are finding place to chill with your friends, you should go this shop, call “Chill Out”.
The only one café in Yangon which can play many international board games. Their characteristic is not only board games, but drinks and Snacks are also tasty. Highly recommend drinking Super Fruit Tea and Strawberry Milk. Brownie, Burger, and Sandwich are also delicious.<br>
<b>Note: </b> Please ask them clearly whether we need to pay extra fees for board game.

		<b>Review: </b> It is a new Korean ice cream shop which has open in Junction City. They have 3 steps of soft serve ice-cream, and you can customize as you like.
For base, there has taiyaki, cup and corn. You can choose chocolate filling and custard filling for taiyaki.
For flavor, there has Matcha, Dark Chocolate, Matcha Chocolate, Hojicha Milk, Strawberry, and Strawberry Hojicha milk.
There have 6 or 7 kinds of topping and you can choose the one you like. For example: Marshmallows, Sprinkles, Oreos crunches, etc. Taste is not too sweet. For matcha, taste is little bitter with matcha’s smell. 
Also, you can get some drinks and deserts.

		<b>Review: </b> Today I went to Fruity Land. The price is drop down from 4000kyats to 2000kyats. So, it is so fair, but the cup is smaller than before. For ice-cream, mango, chocolate, strawberry, durian, and avocado are available. They are made by real fruits. They also have popsicles and other deserts. And there also have mango cheese and durian sweet ball. It is quite special. We can taste the real fruit taste from their ice cream.
